<p>In 2021, several articles were written in the <i>New York Times</i> about Amazon's tendency to fire workers without warning for extremely slight or even non-existent offenses. The articles don't use unethical methods of information gathering such as invasions of privacy, but rather rely on interviews with former and current workers. This method also allows for the reader to connect with the workers more, as they get to hear about what happened in the worker's own voice.</p>
